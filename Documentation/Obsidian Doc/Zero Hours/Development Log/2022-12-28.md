Today i started all of the intitial sprint planning for building the game to a 1 year deadline. This feels pretty ambitous, possibly even undoable, but its a good aspiration as long as i can stick to it. I dont have any real world idea of how long these tasks are likely to take but planning it all out, as much as it feels like procrastination against doing actual hard work, will make things easier in the long run.  Im planning to seriously start working in the new year
