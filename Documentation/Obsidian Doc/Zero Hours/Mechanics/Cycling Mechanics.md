Cycling mechanics are the most detailed mechanics of the game. 

Unity generates a Sine Wave, the peaks and troughs of which represent the apex of either the left or right pedel. An area of this amplitude representing the perfect time to press the left trigger or right which corrospond to the left and right pedel. 

Pressing either of these triggers outside of the correct amplitude will cause a "slip" where the player is briefly unable to peddle and the charecter appears to slip their feet off the peddles

This use of a mathamaterically represented pedelleing cycle is extremely usefull as it allows us to effect the feel of the cycling and the speed of the pedeling algorithmically such as on inclines, while changing gears, losing traction on ice, or other options

Drifting:
Locking up the rear wheel with the rear brake will allow you to drift. This is particularly useful in certain situations

Front Brake: 
Front braking is valuable if you're below a certain speed and need a fast stop, but breaking on the front brake at too high of a speed will cause you to flip over the handlebars

Gears: 
Gear changes will allow you to decrease your peddling speed, at higher speeds, and generally produce more speed than pedelling at full speed if properly timed.
