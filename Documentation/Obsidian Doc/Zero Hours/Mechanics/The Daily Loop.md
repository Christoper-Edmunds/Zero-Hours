Each Day Follows a looping structure as follows 

Wake: 
The player awakes in bed at a set time (7:11) every morning. They immediately check their phone for messages and the player can interact with it or press the phone button to put it away and get up

Walk around:
The player is now free to walk around their house. This opens the door to a variety of daily actions that include 

Talking to flatmates
Bathing (takes time but is required for many relationships and can cause problems if not done)
Eating (player must eat 3 times a day)
Collecting Mail from the door 
Tending the Garden (optional)
Maintaining the Bike
Interact with objects around the house (smoke weed, play videogames, ect) 

Leave The House:
The player can walk out the front door officially starting the day. They walk out holding their bike. The player can then partike in any of the story activities currently accessible, or start work 

Starting Work:
The player opens the Zero App and presses the "Start Working!" button, a little "zero to hero" splash screen plays and the player can beging cycling waiting for an order. Orders follow a similar process to deliveroo where you have to accept the order, go to the collection station  following GPS link from the app, collect from the store, then deliver to final recepient. Orders will occur in a varying frequency and will be tweaked towards making lots of money some days and very little others, but averaging out to around Â£8 an hour (for now)

Finishing work:
Work can be finished at any time as long as you have no delivery pending. You simply stop getting work offers and directions

After Work:
Late in evenings in particular you will have a lot of oppertunity to do chores and side missions, certain things need to be done as part of daily life such as grocery shopping once a week 

Going home:
The player should target to go home early enough to sleep, they will need to also have to eat and bath.
