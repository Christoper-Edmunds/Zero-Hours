The game will be a Third (with optional first) person game about working as a bike courier in a city based off bristol (write what you know lol)

The game will follow a looping core gameplay loop mechanical system, following a loop of, wake up, work, complete side activities, sleep, along with a linier story progression system featuring multiple side stories that can ultimately culminate in a handful of different endings.

A significant core aspect of the game that needs to be considered in all mechanics is a papers please style stress on the player to maintain a degree of economic wealth in order to provide for their basic needs, and to balence this with the players choices in the narratives as well as in when and how much to work and how to maintain and upgrade their bicycle. 

There will be multiple mechanics that comprise the core gameplay loop

[[The Daily Loop]] 
[[Cycling Mechanics]] 
[[Walking Mechanics]]
[[Deliveries]]
[[City Navigation-GPS]]
[[Personal Requirements ]]
[[Bike Maintenence and Upgrading ]]
[[Side Activities]]
[[Side Stories]]
[[Adaptive Music]]
[[Phone Interactions]]
[[The Bag]]

the story progression system functions within these systems by allowing side stories to emerge and be entered into organically as you continue the looping semi random workday schedule. The requirement of the schedule will organically lead you to conversations and events that provoke the start point a side activity, with many ongoing narratives being introduced at this point. Many of these narratives will be focussed around an individual charecter who has entered the players life. This will include narrative love interests and friendships. Additional recurrent charecters (probably some of the more fleshed out) will include the player charecters room mates, who will provide daily ongoing dripfed narrative segments.
