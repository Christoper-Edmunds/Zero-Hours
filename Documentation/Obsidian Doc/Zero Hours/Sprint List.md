1. January
	1. Impliment Basic cycling controls [[Cycling Mechanics]]
		1. Set up Rigid Body
		2. Impliment Sine Wive
		3. Impliment "press RT or LT at right time to pedel when amplitude is either <0.8 or >-0.8"
		4. impliment acceleration effecting frequency of sinewave
		5. impliment braking
		6. impliment gearing effecting sinewave
		7. impliment incline effecting sinewave
	2. Generate Landscape from heightmap 
		1. Heightmap Data allready present in repo
		2. Should be able to just follow the tutorial and complete
	3. Tune cycling controls [[Cycling Mechanics]]
		1. Spend a good amount of time riding around improving the feel of the mechanic and tweaking it, this needs to continue happening at all stages of development, but this is where the bulk of the initial refinement will happen 
	4. Develop spline system 
		1. Impliment a system of quadratic bezier curve splines that can be drawn to represent curving paths rapidly  
	5. Develop splines for roads
		1. Build a repeatable road asset, 30 permutations of street, potholes, grates and clutter (procedurally drop clutter as part of a prefab?)
		2. Get that repeatable asset to deform to the spline and match up seamlessly 
	6. Set up test street with spline system and stand in house assets 
		1. Construct some more test house assets  
		2. Build a large Test Street from existing assets and tools to act as an early test bed 
2. Febuary 	 
	1. Develop Basic Walking Controls [[Walking Mechanics]]
		1. Set up necessary assets
		2. Build new player controller and switch to it 
	2. Develop Bag Functionality 
		1. design grid based bag functionality that can be activated with a button press 
	3. Develop basic delivery functionality using standin UI [[City Navigation-GPS]] 
		1. Throw together some on screen standin UI to show directions and accept delivery 
	4. Develop GPS shortest route following spline network 
		1. Figure out how to select the fastest route along the spline and node network to the destination marker 
	5. Tune Walking Controls 
		1. Get walking controls feeling good, this should be a relatively final draft
	6. SFX and Music Initial first draft
		1. Impliment a general suite of sound and temporary music. These assets will be an ongoing task 
3. March
	1. Set up Phone screen and core delivery functionality with stand in UI 
	2. Build traffic system to follow splines, including track changes at nodes.
	3. Construct larger test space 
	4. Develop Pedestrian spline following system
4. April 
	1. Develop LOD functionality for assets and cell system for unloading active calculations like splines too far away
	2. Impliment Dynamic Music 
	3. Major Art Overhaul: Put into practice ideas about art style, overhaul all existing test assets and replace them with relatively final assets. Construct a cohesive visual style. Plan out assets for further work
5. May
	1. Construct Player Needs system 
	2. Develop "daily loop" overarching day cycle
	3. Construct core functionality of economy
	4. Construct bike maintence mechanics 
	5. develop additional phone functionality (messaging service, calender to double as quest log, notes page ect)
6. June
	1. Construct test side event (meet new stranger in coffee shop)
	2. Impliment Interior Mapping 
	3. Bulk City Asset Creation
7. July
	1. Construct Full City
8. August
		2. Fill City with Side Objectives
9. September
		3. Final Major Art Overhaul
10. October
		4. Exporting, packaging, ect
11. November
12. December
